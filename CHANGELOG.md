# Changelog

Notable changes to the `Arlecchino`, `Arlecchino.Core` and `Arlecchino.Testing` packages. The three ship
together and always carry the same version.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) — with the caveat that on `0.x` a breaking
change only bumps the minor. See [Versioning](docs/packages-and-building.md).

## 0.2.0

First release published on NuGet.

### Added

- Text fields are edited as a real line: a caret drawn where the next character goes, `←`/`→`,
  `Ctrl+←`/`Ctrl+→` by word, `Home`/`End`, `Delete`, `Ctrl+Backspace` and `Ctrl+U`. The logic lives in
  `TextEditing` and applies to the number field too.
- Modals stack. `TuiState.PushModal` opens one over another so a callback can ask a follow-up
  question; closing it uncovers the one underneath, and every level is drawn, offset.
- Bracketed paste. Pasted text arrives as one block through `IView.HandlePaste` or straight into the
  open field, instead of a burst of key presses. On by default (`options.BracketedPaste`).
- Copying a field to the clipboard with `Ctrl+Insert`, encoded as OSC 52 so it works over SSH.
- Scroll bars and a `3/40` position readout in lists, tables, trees and choice modals that hold more
  than fits. `ScrollBar` is public for panes laid out by hand.
- Mouse support on Windows, read from the console's own event queue with `ReadConsoleInput` — the
  platform cannot deliver SGR reports without silencing the keyboard. Quick-edit selection is turned
  off while it runs and restored afterwards.
- A log overlay on `Ctrl+L`. `ArlecchinoLoggerProvider` keeps the last lines in memory rather than
  painting them over the frame, and the overlay scrolls back through them.
- XML documentation on the whole public API of all three packages, enforced by `CS1591` with warnings
  as errors.
- A second sample, `Arlecchino.Processes`: the process list in a sortable table, read in the background,
  filtered from a modal, with a details screen.
- Benchmarks under `benchmarks/Arlecchino.Benchmarks` for frame composition and text measurement.
- The public API of all three packages is now written down in `PublicAPI.*.txt` and enforced by
  `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.PublicApiAnalyzers`, so a change to the surface cannot land unnoticed.

### Fixed

- `LogBuffer` held its lines in a plain list while logging arrives from any thread; it is a concurrent
  queue now and the overlay draws from a snapshot.
- Editing worked in `char` values, so backspace could cut an emoji or a combining sequence in half.
  Movement and deletion go by symbols, and `TextWidth` exposes the boundary helpers.
- A value longer than the terminal hid the caret; the field scrolls now, with `…` on the side that
  continues.
- An escape sequence split across two reads — normal over ssh — was delivered as `Esc`, `[`, `A`. The
  reader waits `options.EscapeTimeout` for the rest.
- The undo stack grew for the lifetime of the process; it is bounded by `StateHistory.Capacity`.
- Being killed (`SIGTERM`, `SIGHUP`) or suspended (`Ctrl+Z`) left the terminal in the alternate screen
  with no cursor. Both are handled now, and `SIGCONT` restores the modes and repaints.
- `ArlecchinoTestHost` drew whatever colour the machine running the tests happened to allow, so a build
  agent with `NO_COLOR` set produced frames with no styling in them and assertions on colour failed. It
  fixes `TerminalCapabilities.Color` at `TrueColor` instead.

### Changed

- Each screen is built in its own DI scope, so views can take scoped services. `IViewFactory.TryCreate`
  now receives the `IServiceProvider` to build from, and `ViewResolver.Create` returns an `ActiveView`
  that owns the scope.
- `ViewLifetime` ties background work to the screen: `Loading<T>()` cancels with it, `Track` disposes
  with it, `Closing` is the token for work started by hand.
- `AsyncState.Cancel()` drops the status back to `Idle` instead of leaving it `Loading`, so a spinner
  stops when the load is abandoned.

- A validation message now follows the field as it is edited and clears the moment the input becomes
  valid, instead of disappearing on the next keystroke. Nothing is reported before the first attempt
  to submit.
- `ITerminal` gained `MouseAvailable`, `ReadMouse`, `EnablePaste`, `DisablePaste` and
  `CopyToClipboard`. Custom terminals have to implement them.
- `TuiState.CloseModal` closes the top modal rather than all of them; `CloseAllModals` does what it
  used to.

## 0.1.0

First release: cell-grid renderer with diff output, view navigation and history, the modal set, forms
bound to atomic state, focus, the widget set, the command palette and per-view commands, the source
generator, mouse support, theming, localisation through delegates, and the headless test host.
